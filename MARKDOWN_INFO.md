You can also use the HTML `<br>` element to go to a new line but with a smaller gap

You can use `*` to set a style of a word (Max 3):

*italic*,

**bold**,

***bold and italic***

You can also use `_` and have the same output:

_italic_ 

__bold__

___bold and italic___

NOTE: You can't mix `*` with `_`

<code>code can be displayed with the html `<code>` element</code> or ``with double ` but single backticks are allowed`` or `like this but backticks are not allowed at all`

The last 2 code blocks are for inline code!

```
code can also
be on multiple lines
if you use 3 backticks instead of 1
```

> This is a blockquote and it begins with the `>` symbol
>> Nested blockquote has 2 `>>` and more

This is an unordered list:
- Each item starts with a `-`
- Item1
- Item2
* `*` also works but you can't mix them

This list is ordered:
1. Item1
2. Item2
3. Item3
4. Each item starts with a number followed by a `.`

Links are specified in this format: `[Name](href)`

[OpenAI](https://openai.com)

[Relative link](docs/readme.md)

Images are specified in this format: `![alt](src title)`

![Alt text](https://via.placeholder.com/100 "Title")

Using 3 `-`, `*`, `-` makes a horizontal rule(or `<hr>`)

Putting text on top of a horizontal rule will make it look like a title
