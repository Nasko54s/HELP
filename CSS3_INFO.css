DISPLAY FLEX ATTRIBUTES

ALIGNMENT:
flex-flow: row wrap - sets the flex direction to row and the flex wrap to wrap
flex-direction - direction of the flex items - row, row-reverse, column, column-reverse
- if the value is column or column-reverse, the main axis is vertical and the cross axis is horizontal
